In the sections below, there is a block diagram \ref{block diagram} of the design and a description of the block diagram with its modules \ref{diagram description}.\par 
\section{Block Diagram}\label{block diagram}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.57]{block_diagram.png}
\end{center}
\newpage
\section{Diagram Description}\label{diagram description}In the diagram presented above in section \ref{block diagram}, there are five inputs and three outputs. All of the inputs are single bit inputs as well as the outputs. \\ \par
\noindent Two of the inputs are taken from switches on the board and their purpose is to select a pre-stored password. The reset input is taken from a push-button from the development board, as well as the clock signal which is taken from the board (50 MHz). The last input comes from a programmed micro-controller and brings the transmitted data into the ASIC. \\ \par
\noindent The outputs are realized on LEDs from the development board. There is an output which will signalize correct parity and another to signalize when the door opens. There is also an output which implements a heart-beat signal to show that the system is running. \\ \par

\noindent The ASIC should be able to input the data which is sent from the micro-controller. The UART receiving principal is implemented regarding this matter at 9600 baud rate line. After the data package is received, the device should check for correct parity. If the condition for correct parity is met, then the data bits from the package are stored in "memory". Finally, after the transmission of all characters is finished, the device should compare the transmitted characters with the switch-selected password (pre-stored characters). If there is a match, an LED should light up.  \\ \par

\noindent A brief description of each block/module inside the design is given below. \\ \par

\subsection{UART - Receiver}
\noindent This module gets an input from the micro-controller and the baud generator, as well as a clock and reset input. It receives a single bit data from the micro-controller at 9600 baud rate. However the sampling will not be done exactly on the rising or the falling edge of the transmitted bit, but roughly in the middle. The purpose of this is to improve the accuracy and reduce errors. After the stop bit, the module sends the received package of 8 bits data, parity bit and stop bit in the Parity Check module. \\ \par
\subsection{9600 Baud Generator}
\noindent This is the module which generates pulses for maintaining the 9600 baud rate transmission or in other words every 104.2 \si{\micro\second} a pulse is generated and send to the UART module. It works on the principle of dividing the clock of 50 \si{\mega\hertz} which is taken as an input.\\ \par
\subsection{Parity Check}
\noindent \\ At this module the parity of the received package is checked. This is done because we want to check for possible errors in the transmission. For the purpose of this project, an even parity will be used, i.e. the number of logic-high bits in the data package (including the parity) should be even. If the parity is correct the 8 data bits are send to the memory , else and error occurred and the received package is dismissed.\\ \par
\subsection{Memory}
\noindent This module needs to store the characters which are received from the micro-controller. The memory stores characters that only passed the parity check. After the transmission, the characters are packed in a 32 bit vector and send to the Comparator module. The stored data is removed when a system reset is done.\\  \par
\subsection{Password Bank}
\noindent At this module, the device keeps the pre-stored characters/passwords. The characters encoding is ASCII. Each password can be selected by two switches which are the inputs of this module. The selected password is packed in a 32 bit vector and send to the Comparator module.\\ \par
\subsection{Comparator}
\noindent This is the module which receives packages of 32 bits from the Memory and from the Password Bank. Its duty is to check/compare both of those packages. If they have the same content, the Comparator sends an output which signalizes that the password is correct, i.e. the door opens. If the password is not correct the LED will not light up.\\  \par
\subsection{Clock Divider}
\noindent This module is used to create a pulse at a required frequency. It divides the system clock up to the particular frequency which should be generated. The pulse will be send as an output to an LED to implement a heart-beat signal on the board. The purpose of this heart-beat signal is to show that the system is running.\\  \par

\chapter{I/O Specifications}
All the I/Os which are used in the design are declared and specified here. It is also given a short description for each I/O as wall as the board pin which is used. \par
